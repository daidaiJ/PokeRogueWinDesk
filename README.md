## About

This is the official Wails Vanilla-TS template.

You can configure the project by editing `wails.json`. More information about the project settings can be found
here: https://wails.io/docs/reference/project-config

## Live Development

To run in live development mode, run `wails dev` in the project directory. This will run a Vite development
server that will provide very fast hot reload of your frontend changes. If you want to develop in a browser
and have access to your Go methods, there is also a dev server that runs on http://localhost:34115. Connect
to this in your browser, and you can call your Go code from devtools.

## Building

To build a redistributable, production mode package, use `wails build`.

## PokeRogue 

This repository is a desktop version of PokeRogue's modified encapsulation, mainly to remove the registration and login pages, get ten times the money, reduce the cost of candies needed to passively unlock Pokémon, 100% drop of the Gym Trainer Voucher, modify the Scorbunny passive, and replace it with adaptability. 

这个仓库是PokeRogue 的数值修改后封装的桌面软件，主要是移除了登录和注册页面，对战中10 倍金钱获取，道馆训练家掉落Voucher 卡券，减少宝可梦被动解锁的糖果花费，经典对战模式幸运值固定14，好运连连啊！并为炎兔儿替换了被动，换成适应力，强劲强劲！
## release version

The executable file on the release of the repository, with the CV suffix, can theoretically be compatible with the older Windows system, embedded webview2.

仓库的release 上的执行文件，带cv 后缀的理论上可以兼容比较老的windows 系统，内嵌 webview2.不带会自动下载webview2 适合新系统，附带的png 图片属ai 生成。
